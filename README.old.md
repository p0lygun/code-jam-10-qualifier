# Code Jam 2023: Qualifier

To qualify for the upcoming Code Jam, you'll have to complete a qualifier assignment. The goal is to make sure you have enough Python knowledge to effectively contribute to a team.

Please read the rules and instructions carefully, and submit your solution before the deadline using the [sign-up form](https://forms.pythondiscord.com/form/cj10-2023-qualifier).

# Qualifying for the Code Jam

To qualify for the Code Jam you will be required to upload your submission to the [sign-up form](https://forms.pythondiscord.com/form/cj10-2023-qualifier).
We set up our test suite so you don't have to worry about setting one up yourself.

Your code will be tested with a multitude of tests to test all aspects of your code making sure it works.

# Rules and Guidelines

- Your submission will be tested using a Python 3.11.4 interpreter with the numpy, Pillow, and opencv-python packages installed. You're allowed to use everything included in Python's standard library and those packages, but nothing else. Please make sure to include the relevant `import` statements in your submission.

- Use [`qualifier.py`](qualifier/qualifier.py) as the base for your solution. It includes stubs for the functions you need to write.

- Do not change the **signatures** of functions included in [`qualifier.py`](qualifier/qualifier.py). The test suite we will use to judge your submission relies on them. Everything else, including the docstring, may be changed.

- Do not include "debug" code in your submission. You should remove all debug prints and other debug statements before you submit your solution.

- This qualifier task is supposed to be **an individual challenge**. You should not discuss (parts of) your solution in public (including our server), or rely on others' solutions to the qualifier. Failure to meet this requirement may result in the **disqualification** of all parties involved. You are still allowed to do research and ask questions about Python as they relate to your qualifier solution, but try to use general examples if you post code along with your questions.

- You can run the tests locally by running the `unittest` suite with `python -m unittest tests.py` or `py -m unittest tests.py` from within the
`./qualifier` directory.
